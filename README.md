# Interactive Telemetry for Design

TODO: (description)
This project aims to enable designers to do data-driven design using active learning.
Telemetry that is collected from the usage of a designerâ€™s prototype can be utilised to
detect anomalies. This data can give insights to designers to improve the prototype. We
will collect our own dataset for testing purposes of a bicycle using a GoPro, which has a
video stream and IMU data (accelerometer and gyroscope). The video stream is only used
to label the behaviour to train a model on the IMU data. After the model is trained, the
model can be used for anomaly detection on only new IMU data, without a video stream.
This approach not only optimises data utilisation for anomaly detection but also aligns
with ethical principles by minimizing privacy risks and environmental impact through
efficient data processing.
